Building a project called world cards,

The idea is to practise rendering different 3d models in react components.

A collection of low poly worlds I have built in Blender.

Each card will be unique..

The aim of the project is to eventually create a collectable card game with many different 3d worlds.
Each one will have various resources as attributes and users can exchange cards.
